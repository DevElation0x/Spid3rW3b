- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Paul
- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m interested in data technology, blockchain development, AI, robotics, science and chemistry.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently learning aws, phython, web & app development. Though I may have been one to venture into understanding how to code later on in life I have always been interested in technology. I never knew what my future held without any formal qualifications my job reach is limited to things I really want to do. When I started I was learning stuff that made absolutely no sense to me but as I expose myself to it as much as possible I find things slowly begin to make sense Which is making it fun, my next step is to start making money from it. 
- ðŸ˜Ž Looking forward to collaborating with some interesting people.
